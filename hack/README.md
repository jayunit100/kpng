# Get up and running w kpng

Run the local-up-kpng.sh script (make sure you have a kind or other cluster ready).

This will run kpng using incluster access to the apiserver, as a daeamonset.

You can test your changes by making sure you run both the `build` and `install` functions in this script.

This is just a first iteration on a dev env for kpng, feel free to edit/add stuff.
